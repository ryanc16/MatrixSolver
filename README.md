# MatrixSolver
This is a simple matrix solving program I made very early in my college days (est. 10/31/2013) when I was learning to program in Java. At the time, I was also taking a math class which was covering matrix math. Naturally, I put the two together and here is the result.

I had forgotten about this program until now, so I went searching my computer, and surprisingly it still existed.

Looking back at this code now and having much more experience, there is a lot to improve upon. Even still I am surprised at how much I managed to accomplish.
